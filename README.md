# NUT Client Monitor Docker Container

A Docker container that monitors a Network UPS Tools (NUT) server and automatically shuts down the host machine when the UPS battery becomes critically low.

## Features

- 🔋 Monitors UPS status via NUT protocol
- 🚨 Automatic host shutdown on critical battery conditions
- 🐳 Containerized for easy deployment
- 🔄 Graceful Docker container shutdown before host shutdown
- 📊 Continuous status logging
- 🏥 Built-in health checks
- 🔧 Configurable check intervals and UPS parameters

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A running NUT server (like `instantlinux/nut-upsd`)
- Host machine that needs automatic shutdown protection

### Basic Usage

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  ups-monitor:
    image: awushensky/nut-client:latest
    container_name: ups-monitor
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      UPS_SERVER: 192.168.1.100  # Your NUT server IP
      UPS_PORT: 3493
      UPS_NAME: ups
      CHECK_INTERVAL: 30
      BATTERY_LEVEL_SHUTDOWN: 20  # Optional, threshold in % for battery level shutdown if ups runs on battery
      ON_BATTERY_TIMEOUT: 300 # Optional, timeout in s for shutdown after change to on battery
    volumes:
      - /proc:/host/proc:ro
    privileged: true
    pid: host
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `UPS_SERVER` | `localhost` | IP address of your NUT server |
| `UPS_PORT` | `3493` | Port of your NUT server |
| `UPS_NAME` | `ups` | Name of the UPS as configured in NUT |
| `CHECK_INTERVAL` | `30` | How often to check UPS status (seconds) |
| `BATTERY_LEVEL_SHUTDOWN` | | Battery level threshold for shutdown if ups runs on battery (percent, optional) |
| `ON_BATTERY_TIMEOUT` | | Timeout for shutdown after change to on battery (seconds, optional) |

### Authentication Notes

This container uses the `upsc` command for read-only UPS status queries. In standard NUT configurations, upsd always provides read-only access to anonymous clients. The user authentication feature is there only for granting access to control actions (e.g. upsrw changing UPS parameters, or upscmd triggering calibration, or upsmon setting 'forced shutdown').

If your NUT server requires authentication even for read access, you may need to:
- Configure network-level security (VPN, firewall rules)
- Use TLS certificates with `CERTREQUEST REQUIRE` in upsd.conf
- Contact the container maintainer for authentication support

### Required Docker Settings

- `privileged: true` - Required for host shutdown capability via nsenter/signaling
- `pid: host` - **Required** for accessing host's init process (PID 1)

> **Why `pid: host`?** The container uses various methods to execute shutdown commands on the host. Without `pid: host`, PID 1 refers to the container's init process, not the host's, making host shutdown impossible.

> **Shutdown Methods:** The container automatically detects the best available shutdown method:
> - `nsenter` - Direct host namespace access (most reliable)
> - `systemd_signal` - Systemd-specific signals when systemd is detected
> - `systemctl` - If systemctl command is available in container
> - `sysrq` - Kernel SysRq trigger (if writable)
> - `signal` - Direct init process signaling (fallback)

## NUT Server Setup

The `instantlinux/nut-upsd` container is configured entirely through environment variables - no config files needed!

### NUT Server Configuration

```yaml
services:
  nut-server:
    image: instantlinux/nut-upsd:latest
    container_name: nut-server
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      NAME: "servers"                   # UPS name (what clients connect to)
      SERIAL: YOUR_UPS_SERIAL_HERE      # Your UPS serial number  
      API_USER: ${NUT_UPS_USER}         # Username for API access
      API_PASSWORD: ${NUT_UPS_PASSWORD} # Password for API access
      DRIVER: usbhid-ups                # UPS driver (optional)
    ports:
      - "3493:3493"
    privileged: true
    devices:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
```

## How It Works

1. **Monitoring**: Container continuously polls the NUT server for UPS status
2. **Detection**: Watches for `OB` (On Battery) + `LB` (Low Battery) conditions
3. **Optinal Detection**: Watches for `OB` (On Battery) and a certain timeout or a battery trashhold
4. **Shutdown Sequence**:
   - Logs critical condition
   - Stops all Docker containers gracefully
   - Waits 10 seconds for cleanup
   - Shuts down the host using `nsenter` to break out of container namespace

## Status Codes

The monitor looks for these UPS status combinations:
- `OL` - Online (normal operation)
- `OB` - On Battery (power outage)
- `LB` - Low Battery (critical - triggers shutdown)
- `OB LB` - On Battery + Low Battery (immediate shutdown)

## Logs

Monitor the container logs to see UPS status:

```bash
docker logs -f ups-monitor
```

Example output:
```
Starting UPS monitor for ups@192.168.1.100:3493
✓ Host namespace access confirmed

2024-01-15 10:35:00: CRITICAL - UPS is on battery and low battery detected!
